Explain to me as a beginner, what syntax in C# is

In programming, syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate how programs written in a particular language are structured. It's like the grammar of a programming language. Each programming language has its own syntax.

Now, let's talk specifically about C#. C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It's widely used for building Windows applications, web applications, and more.

In C#, the syntax includes rules about how you write statements, declare variables, define functions, and so on. Here are a few basic concepts in C# syntax:

Statements: In C#, you write statements to perform actions. Statements are usually terminated with a semicolon (;). For example:
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");

Variables: You use variables to store and manipulate data. Here's how you declare a variable:
int myNumber = 42;
This declares an integer variable named myNumber and assigns it the value 42.

Functions/Methods: Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. Here's a simple example:
void MyFunction()
{
    Console.WriteLine("This is a function!");
}
In this example, MyFunction is a function that prints a message to the console.

Conditionals: C# has constructs for making decisions in your code. For example:
int x = 10;

if (x > 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("x is greater than 5");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("x is not greater than 5");
}
This checks if the value of x is greater than 5 and prints a message accordingly.

Loops: Loops allow you to repeat a block of code. For instance:
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
This loop will print the numbers from 0 to 4.
